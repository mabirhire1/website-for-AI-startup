# NeuralVision AI - Development Workflow Guide

Welcome to the OMAX.AI repository! This README outlines our Git workflow for development contributions.

## Repository Structure

Our application consists of:
- Main website interface (`index.html`)
- Navigation system
- Contact information system
- Other features (to be added)

## Development Workflow

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/website-for-AI-startup.git
   cd website
   ```

2. Make sure you're on the main branch
   ```
   git switch main
   ```

3. Create the initial `index.html` file
   ```
   touch index.html
   ```

4. Add the basic HTML structure to `index.html`
   ```
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Create initial index.html"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Feature: Update Navigation

1. Create a new branch from main
   ```
   git switch main
   git pull origin main
   git switch -c update-navigation
   ```

2. Make your changes to the navigation
   - Update the relevant files
   - Test your changes locally

3. Commit and push your changes
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update navigation system"
   git push origin update-navigation
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request
   - Go to the repository on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select `update-navigation` as your source branch and `main` as the target
   - Add a descriptive title and detailed description
   - Request reviews from team members

5. Review Process
   - Address feedback from reviewers
   - Make additional commits if necessary
   - Once approved, merge the PR

### Feature: Add Contact Information

1. Create a new branch from the updated main
   ```
   git switch main
   git pull origin main  # Pull the latest changes including the merged navigation update
   git switch -c add-contact-info
   ```

2. Implement the contact information features
   - Add contact form, information, etc.
   - Test your changes locally

3. Commit and push your changes
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add contact information system"
   git push origin add-contact-info
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request
   - Go to the repository on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select `add-contact-info` as your source branch and `main` as the target
   - Add a descriptive title and detailed description
   - Request reviews from team members

5. Review Process
   - Address feedback from reviewers
   - Make additional commits if necessary
   - Once approved, merge the PR

## Best Practices

- Always pull the latest changes from main before creating a new branch
- Keep commits small and focused on a single task
- Write clear commit messages
- Test your changes thoroughly before creating a PR
- Request reviews from at least one team member
